# Lesson 2.1: `pubspec.yaml` Deep Dive

In this lesson, we will examine the dependencies required to build a GenUI application. Open the `pubspec.yaml` file in the `travel_app` directory to follow along.

## Core GenUI Packages

The `travel_app` relies on three primary packages from the GenUI ecosystem:

### 1. `genui`
```yaml
genui: ^0.5.1
```
This is the core package. It provides:
-   **`GenUiManager`**: The central controller for the UI generation lifecycle.
-   **`GenUiConversation`**: Manages the state of the chat and the stream of UI updates.
-   **`Catalog` & `CatalogItem`**: Classes to define the components available to the AI.
-   **`AiTool`**: The base class for defining tools (functions) the AI can call.

### 2. `genui_google_generative_ai` (or `genui_firebase_ai`)
```yaml
genui_google_generative_ai: ^0.5.1
# OR
genui_firebase_ai: ^0.5.1
```
These packages provide the implementation for the **`ContentGenerator`** interface. They handle the communication with the specific LLM provider.
-   **`genui_google_generative_ai`**: Connects directly to Google's Gemini API. This is great for quick prototyping and testing.
-   **`genui_firebase_ai`**: Connects to Vertex AI via Firebase. This is recommended for production apps as it allows for better security and backend management.

### 3. `json_schema_builder`
```yaml
json_schema_builder: ^0.1.3
```
This package is essential for defining the **Data Schema** of your catalog items. LLMs understand JSON schemas very well. This package allows you to define schemas in Dart code using a fluent API (e.g., `S.object`, `S.string`), which are then converted to the JSON format the LLM expects.

## Supporting Packages

### `gpt_markdown`
```yaml
gpt_markdown: ^1.1.4
```
GenUI applications often mix structured UI with free-form text. The AI might return a description formatted in Markdown. This package is used to render that text beautifully within your Flutter app.

### `intl`
```yaml
intl: ^0.20.2
```
Used for formatting dates and numbers, which is common in travel apps (e.g., formatting check-in dates or prices).

## Dev Dependencies

### `network_image_mock`
```yaml
network_image_mock: ^2.1.1
```
This is useful for testing. Since GenUI apps often display images from URLs (generated by the AI), this package helps mock those network requests during widget tests.
